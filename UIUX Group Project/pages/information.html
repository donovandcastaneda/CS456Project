        <h1>Detailed Information on Color Blindness</h1>
    
        <h2>Genetic Aspects:</h2>
        <p>Color blindness is predominantly a genetic condition, inherited through a recessive gene carried by the mother on the X chromosome. Males are more commonly affected because they only have one X chromosome, unlike females who have two.</p>
    
        <h2>Types of Color Blindness:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protanomaly (Reduced Red Sensitivity):</strong> Individuals see red colors as more greenish and less brightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Protanopia (Red Blindness):</strong> Red appears as black, with certain shades of orange, yellow, and green appearing as yellow.</li>
            <li><strong>Deuteranomaly (Reduced Green Sensitivity):</strong> Yellow and green appear more red, and it is difficult to tell violet from blue.</li>
            <li><strong>Deuteranopia (Green Blindness):</strong> Reds look brownish-yellow, and greens look beige.</li>
            <li><strong>Tritanomaly (Reduced Blue Sensitivity):</strong> Blue appears greener and it can be difficult to tell yellow and red from pink.</li>
            <li><strong>Tritanopia (Blue Blindness):</strong> Blue appears green and yellow appears violet or light grey.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Diagnostic Tests:</h2>
        <p>Several tests exist to diagnose color blindness, including:
            <ul>
                <li>The Ishihara Test: A series of plates with colored dots form a number that is visible to individuals with normal color vision.</li>
                <li>Anomaloscope: Examines the color matching capabilities of individuals.</li>
                <li>Cambridge Color Test: Assesses color discrimination ability.</li>
                <li>Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test: Evaluates an individual's ability to arrange colored chips based on hue.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
        <h2>Managing Color Blindness:</h2>
        <p>While there's no cure, various aids and strategies exist to assist individuals, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Color-correcting glasses and contact lenses.</li>
                <li>Digital applications that adjust the color settings on screens.</li>
                <li>Use of high-contrast settings and alternative cues (such as text labels) in visual designs.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
        <h2>Research Advancements:</h2>
        <p>Research in gene therapy, specifically in replacing the faulty genes responsible for color blindness, shows promise. Other lines of investigation include developing visual aids with color-correcting technology.</p>
    
        <h2>Impact on Daily Life:</h2>
        <p>Color blindness can affect many areas of life including job choice, safety, and daily convenience. However, with understanding, accommodations, and the use of available aids, individuals can lead fulfilling lives.</p>
