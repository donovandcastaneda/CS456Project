                <h1>Understanding Color Blindness</h1>

                <p>Color blindness, also known as color vision deficiency (CVD), is a genetic condition that affects an individual's ability to perceive colors. Here are some key points about color blindness:</p>
            
                <h2>1. Prevalence:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Color blindness affects approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women worldwide.</li>
                    <li>It's more common among individuals of Northern European descent.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>2. Types:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Red-Green Color Blindness:</strong> This is the most common form, where individuals have difficulty distinguishing between red and green hues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blue-Yellow Color Blindness:</strong> This is a rarer form, where individuals have trouble distinguishing between blue and yellow hues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Color Blindness:</strong> A very rare form, where individuals see the world in shades of gray.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>3. Causes:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The primary cause is genetic, passed down through families.</li>
                    <li>Other causes can include certain eye conditions, aging, or exposure to harmful chemicals or radiation.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>4. Diagnosis:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Color blindness is usually diagnosed using color vision tests such as the Ishihara Test.</li>
                    <li>If you suspect you may be color blind, it's advisable to visit an eye care professional for a comprehensive examination.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>5. Living with Color Blindness:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>While there's no cure for genetic color blindness, corrective lenses or digital tools can help individuals perceive colors more accurately.</li>
                    <li>Awareness and understanding from others can significantly improve the quality of life for those with color blindness.</li>
                </ul>
